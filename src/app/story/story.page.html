    <h3 class="w3-center">The Journey to FIRST Global 2019</h3>
    <p>
      Team Sudan 2019 journey may have started a bit late in August due to the situation of the country but still went
      very well. it started when FIRST Global partner in Sudan InnoBay with the help of Mr. Faisal chose Team Sudan
      members after reviewing more than 60 CVs countering applicants technical and soft skills, their records and
      achievements in STEM field also their previous contribution in local and global competitions and exhibitions. The
      mentors were chosen according to their highly qualities and elementary skills in leadership, management, team
      work, besides the technical skills for sure. After a good study for the CVs 5 students, 1 mentor, and 1 team
      manager were chosen, according to their excellent records.

      After the team was chosen, the team had an introduction session, and the session went well specially that team
      members already know each other from their past contributions. After this session, team members received all the
      challenge manuals and materials from their mentors. Team members had meetings every day to plan and learn more.
      Although we suffered through several obstacles, starting from the place to settle in, the KIT arrival and power
      stability. But team members were working in harmony like a beehive with positivity, hard work, self-discipline,
      time respect, and determination even through hard times.

    <p>
      After having the KIT we still have problem with no permanent venue, so Schools for gifted and talented students
      solved the problem temporarily, although electricity was often went out due to shortness in the country in
      overall.

      Eventually Baylasan rented an office for the Team via Mr.Faisal and this made our work more effective and
      organized, Team worked from 8:30 AM to 3:30 PM or more every single day except for Friday, sometimes Friday too is
      a working day. But due to the level of living in Sudan, Team suffered most of the times from lack of
      transformations, weather hot temperature (40 degrees), and electricity shut downs. And if the sky rained the next
      day all the streets will be filled with water and mud which make it harder to reach the team’s office. Although
      Team Sudan faced many difficult obstacles but that didn’t stop the team from its duties, since day one the team
      showed a strong well of achieving high ranks in FGC and the team didn’t missed a working day since the beginning
      with high team spirit and positivity

      In our activities side we made many video calls with several teams and we are planning to have more since we are
      almost done from the robot.
      We made a great traditional day, we prepared for it very well in order to introduce other teams about our culture,
      food, and clothes. On this day we made a great sponsorship for the day including Make-up, accessories, food, venue
      and photography.
      We made steady steps in order to find an official sponsorship in order to promote STEM in Sudan persuading through
      meetings, calls and emails, but unfortunately no one made a positive feedback but Team Sudan is still trying and
      he hopes to get positive feedbacks from the sponsors next days.
